# SYSTEM DESCRIPTION:

The SwapIt project aims to create a platform that allows people to exchange skills and knowledge in a simple and immediate way. The main objective is to promote mutual learning, break down the economic barriers associated with education, and build an active and inclusive community.
SwapIt users will be able to offer their skills in exchange for other abilities they are interested in, without the need to use money.
